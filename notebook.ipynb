    "## Abstract:\n",
    "Have you ever watched a game where you were really satisfied with your team's performance, the interplay between players, awareness, energy, and overall approach to the game, even though you don't win the game? \"Our team was just unlucky, we hit the bar 5 times!\" What about a really poor performance where you team still managed to scrap for the win? \n",
    "\n",
    "When human beings watch a game, we are processing the underlying numbers. We might not have the statistics to back it up, but we usually have a feeling that player X played really well. His crosses were really good there just wasn't anyone to head them in...\n",
    "How good can symbolic regression predict teams to be by looking at the underlying numbers?"

    "### Dataset\n",
    "All the datasets were obtained from www.footystats.org.\n",
    "The data is the statstics that each Premier League team has generated in a Leage football in a season, from the 2010/2011 season to the 2021/2022. It is divided into 2 categories:\n",
    "- Pre-XG category: Before the 2016/17 season, the data lacks the expected goals (XG) metrics as the algorithm for measuring the expected goals from an attacking opportunity had not yet been standardized across football. So we have 0 for every XG derived metric. So I combined all the data from the 10/11 season to the 14/15 season into one dataset.\n",
    "- XG category: From 2016/17 season, and includes all the expected goals metrics (XG for, XG against, and their corresponding averages). So here, I combined data from the 16/17 to the 19/20 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The daset has 293 features, of which 261 will be fitted by our models, from goals and expected goals, to goals conceded in the specific 10 minute slices of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this difference is important\n",
    "- XG (Expected Goals) is an important statistic in soccer (football) analytics that quantifies the quality of scoring opportunities based on various factors such as distance from goal, angle, type of shot, and defensive pressure. It provides a numerical measure of the likelihood that a shot will result in a goal."

    "\n",
    "##### Why XG is useful in predicting team performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Objective Performance Evaluation: XG allows for a more objective evaluation of a team's performance by considering the quality of scoring opportunities rather than just the number of goals scored. It provides a more accurate reflection of a team's attacking prowess and defensive strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Identifying Underlying Trends: By analyzing XG over time, patterns can emerge that highlight a team's consistent ability to create high-quality chances or prevent opponents from doing so. This helps identify teams with sustainable performance levels or those experiencing a stroke of luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performance Comparison: XG can be used to compare the performance of teams within a league or across different leagues. It provides a standardized metric to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of teams' offensive and defensive strategies, enabling fairer comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Predictive Power: XG has proven to be a reliable predictor of future performance. Teams with consistently high XG values are more likely to convert their chances and maintain their performance over time. It helps in predicting a team's potential goal-scoring and defensive capabilities.\n",

    "    Incomplete Information: Knowing the number of goals actually scored provides limited information about the quality of scoring opportunities.

By considering xG, which quantifies the quality of scoring chances, models gain a more comprehensive understanding of a team's performance.\n",

    "# Conclusions, Limitations, and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. CONCLUSIONS and IMPLICATIONS:\n",
    "- We have developed an approach and combined the results of two machine learning models capable of predicting the most important positions in a league table- the top 6 and the bottom 6- all by looking only at statistics generated durring games.\n",
    "- There is clearly a good way to play (or underlying numbers you need to generate) to secure your position in the places for European competition Qualification (UEFA Champions League and Europa League).\n",
    "- Similarly, there is a bad way to play (or a combination of underlying numbers to avoid) that will leave your team struggling in relegation places."

   "id": "e700064c",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 2. LIMITATIONS\n",
    "- This approach in particular fails to at least predict the final position of two teams, team 14 and team 19.\n",
    "- Team 14, Aston Villa is predicted to be 10th but was 14th and team 19, Wolverhampton Wanderers, is predicted to be 14th but was 10th.\n",
    "- It is worth to note that there is only a 7 point difference between them, the 10th and 14th. For reference, there is a 24 point difference between the 1st and 5th, and a 17 point difference between the 16th and the 20th.\n",
    "- So clearly, our approach is strongest for predicting both ends of the table. The task gets progressively harder as you move towards the middle where team profile and performance tends to be more or less the same. We saw that in the middle of the table some teams are predicted to have the same position.\n",
    "- It is not yet clear why a symbolic regression model is capable of predicting well points per game, but erring severely when predicting league positions.\n",
    "- The same could be said for random forest models being more suited for league position prediction than points per game.\n",
    "- This approach is limited in place (English Premier League) and scope (2016 - present)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK.\n",
    "- There is need for further investigation now to determine the  importance of these in-game metrics relative to each other and how they contribute to performance in the English premier league.\n",
    "- There is need to generate similar models for other leagues, and improve on this one as well. Football is a  local phenomenon, both in time and place. So, I predict this approach will only be good at predicting performance in the English Premier League during this tactics era, where positional play, high possession, and a high pressing are trending."
