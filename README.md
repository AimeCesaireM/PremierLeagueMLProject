Abstract:

Have you ever watched a game where you were really satisfied with your team's performance, the interplay between players, awareness, energy, and overall approach to the game, even though you don't win the game? "Our team was just unlucky, we hit the bar 5 times!" What about a really poor performance where you team still managed to scrap for the win?

When human beings watch a game, we are processing the underlying numbers. We might not have the statistics to back it up, but we usually have a feeling that player X played really well. His crosses were really good there just wasn't anyone to head them in... How good can symbolic regression predict teams to be by looking at the underlying numbers?
